      <p align="JUSTIFY">The Final Report of the Select Committee on U.S.
      National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the Peoples’
      Republic of China was unanimously approved by the five Republicans and
      four Democrats who served on the Select Committee.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This three-volume Report is a declassified, redacted
      version of the Final Report. The Final Report was classified Top Secret
      when issued on January 3, 1999, and remains so today. Certain source
      materials included in the Final Report were submitted to the Executive
      branch during the period August-December 1998 for declassification review
      in order to facilitate the production of a declassified report. The Select
      Committee sought declassification review of the entire report on January
      3, 1999. The House of Representatives extended the life of the Select
      Committee for 90 days for the purpose of continuing to work with the
      Executive branch to declassify the Final Report. A series of further
      extensions was voted by the House of Representatives until the final
      declassification review was completed in May 1999. Following an extended
      series of negotiations between the House of Representatives and the
      Executive branch, a number of material deletions have been made to the
      Final Report.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">As a result of these deletions, a number of significant
      events, facts, and analyses have been omitted from this declassified
      Report. In several cases, important factual examples substantiating
      conclusions in the report have been deleted. In other cases, explicit
      findings of the Select Committee have been suppressed. The Select
      Committee’s classified Final Report, therefore, remains the definitive
      product of its investigation and analysis.</p>
